### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jietse
#### Student Master Bioinformatics @ Ghent University
Hello!
My name is Jietse, a student at Ghent University. During the course of my studies in bioinformatics, the coding bug has bitten me while learning to work with Python and R. I saw the capabilities of the Python language and am now trying to teach myself new applications of the language that can help me in my daily life. I'm a collector of PokÃ©mon trading cards and writing several programs that could be helpful in the management of my collection. Furthermore I like to be outdoors working in the garden.

Skills: Python/R/Linux CLI

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a database GUI for my collection PokÃ©mon cards 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write GUI's in Python
